## Hi, I'm a Software Quality Analyst, I have comprehensive experience in the various phases of the software development process, with a focus on quality assurance. I support the development team, applying different types and techniques of software testing. I have mastery in planning, creation and execution of manual test plans and cases, as well as critical analysis of requirements and acceptance criteria.

My experience includes using black box testing techniques to identify possible failures and ensure product quality. In addition, I have knowledge and practice in automated testing, covering end-to-end (E2E) testing. I am also familiar with functional testing strategies, allowing a comprehensive assessment of software performance and usability.

Based on my experience, I am able to efficiently conduct testing activities, contributing to the delivery of quality products, identifying and solving potential problems. I have a critical eye and attention to detail, constantly seeking continuous improvement of processes and customer satisfaction.
